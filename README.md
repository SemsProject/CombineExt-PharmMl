# Extension of CombineExt for PharmML

This is an extension of the [CombineExt](https://sems.uni-rostock.de/trac/combine-ext/wiki) library ([see also](https://github.com/binfalse/CombineExt)) to add support for PharmML and to show how to extend the CombineExt library.

Using this extension you are able to recognize PharmML files. In addition, this extension provides an icon representing PharmML files: ![PharmML icon](https://sems.uni-rostock.de/trac/combine-ext-pharmml/export/master/src/main/resources/icons/Green-pharmml.png). See the [Demo.java](https://github.com/binfalse/CombineExt-PharmML/blob/master/src/main/java/de/unirostock/sems/cbext/pharmml/Demo.java) to learn how to use this extension.

Find more information on how to use and extend the library on the [web page of the library](https://sems.uni-rostock.de/trac/combine-ext/wiki) and on the [web page of this extension](https://sems.uni-rostock.de/trac/combine-ext-pharmml).
